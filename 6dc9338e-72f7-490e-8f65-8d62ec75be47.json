To do this, they built a team in the UK and USA with Blackstone as a capital partner to utilise expertise, technology and resources to build a national network and scale quickly within multi-family housing and affordable social housing sectors. In 2012 Invitation Homes was set up with a small core team and within three years expanded to over 1,400 staff with 50,000 properties (and approximately 1,500 Section 8 properties in affordable social housing), acquiring 1,000 units a week at its peak in 13 major markets. In February 2017 Invitation Homes raised $1.54 billion in an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (INVH) with a TEV of around $10 billion. Invitation Homes subsequently merged with Starwood Waypoint Homes in November 2017 to create the largest private owner and operator of single-family rental homes in the United States. The combined companies created an $18billion TEV Real Estate Investment Trust and approximately 82,000 single-family rental homes.

Signed contracts & drove product launch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Vodafone, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia, Dell, HP, Sony, Toshiba and ASUS. ** Provided strategic advice & analysis to Qualcomm CXO leadership to shift chipset product line to multi-mode 4G/3G (LTE/HSPA+/EVDOrC). Provided strategy for 4G/3G chipset technology roadmap, product plan, & market positioning. Advocated that rather than \"killing Qualcomm\\'s IP licensing value\" as was feared by Qualcomm\\'s leadership at the time, this 4G/3G industry roadmap was the only practical way the industry could adopt 4G and would \"extend Qualcomm\\'s IP licensing value for a decade\". On this advice, Qualcomm combined three different 4G engineering development groups into one engineering team focused on delivering world\\'s first multi-mode 4G/3G chipsets. This announcement shifted global carrier and cell phone OEM roadmaps over to multi-mode LTE, EVDO and HSPA chips, effectively ending 802.20, LTE and WiMax. This led to a market dominating decade long growth run for Qualcomm\\'s cellular chipset line. ** Departed Qualcomm to return to Silicon Valley entrepreneurial activities. http://www.qualcomm.com/gobi http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2iJZYaXHfU', 'position_title': 'Vice President, Mobile Internet', 'duration': None, 'location': 'San Diego'}, {'institution_name': 'Airgo Networks', 'linkedin_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/15919/', 'website': None, 'industry': None, 'type': None, 'headquarters': None, 'company_size': None, 'founded': None, 'from_date': 'Feb 2001', 'to_date': 'Oct 2006', 'description': \"Founded Airgo with five friends (VK, Dave, Ali, Richard and Geert).
