We actively manage capital for our investors. Mercadyne has offices in Las Vegas, Nevada and Portland, Oregon. We employ a research-intensive investment approach which seeks non-correlation to the broad market indices. We utilize fundamental quantitative and qualitative analysis, technical analysis, assessment of securities and broad market behavior, trading psychology and return risk profiling to select investments across asset classes, instrument types, industry sectors and geographies. Our organizational structure decentralizes investment research and analysis and centralizes decision-making and risk management. This approach enables us to avail ourselves of a broad range of ideas and expertise from within the firm, consulting research firms and peers, while ensuring that we possess and maintain portfolio control and comprehensive risk management.
