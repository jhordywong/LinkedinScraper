Lessors register at no cost simply by completing a detailed profile that captures the deal sizes, credits, geographies, and asset types that they finance at www.lessornetwork.com. Then, thanks to our intelligent matching technology, when any one of our clients has a lease deal that matches a lessor's profile, the client can research the lessor\u2019s full profile, and decide to include them in a competitive bid (aka sourcing event). Lessors can then pursue and win opportunities they otherwise would not see. Lessors like it because they receive transaction opportunities with all of the information that they need to win new business at their fingertips, while greatly reducing their origination costs. Registration is free: www.lessornetwork.com. \\n\\nOur lessee clients value the service because they can find lessors that exactly match their needs in any country where they do business, which saves them time and money. We've transacted more than $2B in competitive bids in 26 countries covering many asset types: material handling (lots of forklifts), IT (servers, storage, laptops), networking gear, truck, trailer, and car fleets, corporate aircraft (fun!), rail cars, machine tools, measurement equipment -- you name it. We have about 550 lessors registered around the world; 185 in the US, including all of the big banks and top brands. We get an average of 7 bids per event (11 in health care -- very competitive space) and our lessee clients save 7% on average on a PV basis.
