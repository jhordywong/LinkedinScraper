The underlying objective is to increase a photo/video\u2019s shelf-life and depth of audiences\u2019 participation over time.\\nSkills: Social Media Analytics \u00b7 Brand Marketing \u00b7 B2C Marketing \u00b7 Consumer Software\\nSkills:Social Media Analytics \u00b7 Brand Marketing \u00b7 B2C Marketing \u00b7 Consumer Software\\nHynt Careers\\nHynt Careers\", 'position_title': 'Founder', 'duration': None, 'location': 'Toronto, Canada Area'}, {'institution_name': 'Dynamic Signal\\nDynamic Signal', 'linkedin_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/1604432/', 'website': None, 'industry': None, 'type': None, 'headquarters': None, 'company_size': None, 'founded': None, 'from_date': 'Sep 2014', 'to_date': 'Mar 2015', 'description': None, 'position_title': 'Vice President Client Services', 'duration': '7 mos', 'location': 'San Francisco Bay Area'}, {'institution_name': 'Dynamic Signal\\nDynamic Signal', 'linkedin_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/1604432/', 'website': None, 'industry': None, 'type': None, 'headquarters': None, 'company_size': None, 'founded': None, 'from_date': 'Jun 2010', 'to_date': 'Sep 2014', 'description': None, 'position_title': 'Director, Client Services (Founding Team)', 'duration': '4 yrs 4 mos', 'location': 'San Francisco Bay Area \u00b7 On-site'}, {'institution_name': 'Adify (now part of COX Enterprises)', 'linkedin_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/163234/', 'website': None, 'industry': None, 'type': None, 'headquarters': None, 'company_size': None, 'founded': None, 'from_date': 'Oct 2007', 'to_date': 'Oct 2010', 'description': \"Responsible for successfully deploying Adify's software platform and services across enterprise media clients across the globe; startup founded by team that built one of the first performance based online ad networks (Flycast); well-funded startup backed by Venrock, USVP, and NBC; multi-faceted role that combines working one-on-one with clients and prospects to understand their requirements, creating custom web-based solutions, and implementing those solutions into complex enterprise software environments; good business development and technical sales experience\\nResponsible for successfully deploying Adify's software platform and services across enterprise media clients across the globe; startup founded by team that built one of the first performance based online ad networks (Flycast); well-funded startup backed by Venrock, USVP, and NBC; multi-faceted role that combines working one-on-one with clients and prospects to understand their requirements, creating custom web-based solutions, and implementing those solutions into complex enterprise software environments; good business development and technical sales experience\\nSkills: Ad Tech \u00b7 Customer Retention \u00b7 Pre-Sales Technical Consulting \u00b7 Data Analytics \u00b7 Team Leadership\\nSkills:Ad Tech \u00b7 Customer Retention \u00b7 Pre-Sales Technical Consulting \u00b7 Data Analytics \u00b7 Team Leadership\\nCox Enterprises buys ad network builder Adify for $300M\\nCox Enterprises buys ad network builder Adify for $300M\\nNews of our acquisition, one of the largest B2B deals in 2008\\nNews of our acquisition, one of the largest B2B deals in 2008\", 'position_title': 'Director, Enterprise Client Services', 'duration': None, 'location': ''}, {'institution_name': 'Keystone Strategy', 'linkedin_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/609798/', 'website': None, 'industry': None, 'type': None, 'headquarters': None, 'company_size': None, 'founded': None, 'from_date': 'May 2005', 'to_date': 'Sep 2007', 'description': 'Devising business ecosystem, product development and IT benchmarking strategies for high-tech companies based on differentiated research and deep industry experience originating at Harvard Business School; good Product Marketing expertise resulting from deep engagements with top software clients\\nDevising business ecosystem, product development and IT benchmarking strategies for high-tech companies based on differentiated research and deep industry experience originating at Harvard Business School; good Product Marketing expertise resulting from deep engagements with top software clients', 'position_title': 'Business Consultant', 'duration': None, 'location': ''}, {'institution_name': 'Iron Horse Interactive', 'linkedin_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/1063315/', 'website': None, 'industry': None, 'type': None, 'headquarters': None, 'company_size': None, 'founded': None, 'from_date': 'Oct 2004', 'to_date': 'Dec 2004', 'description': 'Led and assisted with \u201cDigital Home\u201d technology strategy projects at startup consulting firm.
