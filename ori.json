I led the softswitch transition with SS7 at Lucent, legacy voice, data to VoLTE and packet core transition at Starent, founded Parallel Wireless and grew it to be a leader in All G OpenRAN.\n\nTo continue on the telecom disruption path, I have decided to start a new venture A5G Networks. I really enjoyed building and growing the team at Parallel Wireless and made many great friends. While I am going to miss the team, I am thrilled about my new journey with A5G Networks. Looking forward to working with the best minds in the industry and drive the 5G disruption. A5G is the trail blazer to create the mobile networks of the future.",
